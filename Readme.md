# Project Title
sql-challenge

# Project Description
This project consists of starting with an ERD to design a series of tables to then query for results.

The database and tables were setup using a local copy of pgAdmin4.

It uses https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to create an ERD as well as the Postgres setup for the tables. 

# How to Install and Run the Project
This set of extracts and queries are designed to run on a Postgres SQL database.

Running the QuickDBD-sql-challenge-export.sql file on a database will create the series of tables. The QuickDBD-export.png file is an image of the table's structure.

Data for each table is stored in the 'data' folder and can be uploaded to their respectively named tables.

You can then run the solution_queries.sql file on the database to query the tables.

# How to use the project

This project can be used to create a set of tables with base data to manipulate and join.
